# C-Sharp-Tutorial-Programs
Repository of all the practice programs I have completed in C#


What I'm going to be doing in this repository is basically uploading solutions that I created when following along with a tutorial video on youtube to gain knowledge of the langauge C#. I will also be making a lot of comments, mainly for the sake of me reiterating what has been explained in the video, draw any similaritesto C++ (which I'm most familiar with) or break down some conecepts to make sure I'm understandingwhat is happening in the code.

Beware of horrible spelling!


Here is the link to the video I am following. Forgot to link this earlier. Also note that I'm not copying everything done in the video, for some concepts I felt it wasn't worth to code, like logcial and arthimatic operators.
